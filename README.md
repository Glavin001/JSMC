## About

### Why?

- Lightweight and cross-platform  
  I want to and currently cannot run Plex Media Server on my Raspberry Pi
- Robust media scanning  
  Plex Media Server does not always recognize files in my library. 
  I want it to be flexible and handle many file names instead of conforming to [strict file name conventions](https://support.plex.tv/hc/en-us/categories/200028098-Media-Preparation)
- Virtual Assistant integration in it's core  
  [Wit.ai](https://wit.ai/) for Speech Recognition and Natural Language processing.
  Start a dialog to plan which movie to watch tonight, based on history, ratings, genre, cast, directors, and 
  then automatically push your selection to your TV with Chromecast, all hands-free.
